Dick Sites (and others) at Google graciously provided a new version
2.0 of the compact language detector, here:

  https://code.google.com/p/cld2/

and I (lucene@mikemccandless.com) created the Python bindings and
ported the C++ test case to test.py.

This has been tested on Ubuntu 12.10, with both Python 2.7.3 and
3.2.3.

To build:

  * First checkout cld2 and run internal/compile_libs.sh.  This will
    create both libcld2.so (detects 83 languages) and libcld2_full.so
    (detects 163 languages).  Install those libraries somewhere on
    your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  * Edit both setup.py and setup_full.py: edit CLD2_PATH to point to
    where you checked out the CLD2 sources.

  * python setup.py build

  * python setup_full.py build


To test both the small and full language tables:

  * python test.py

The test produces a lot of output, due to the test cases testing the
debug flags; this is normal.  As long as it says OK in the end then
the tests passed.

To install:

  * python setup.py install (as root)

  * python setup_full.py install (as root)

For documentation run:

  * python -c "import cld2; help(cld2.detect)"

NOTE: gen_test.py and gen_enc.py were used as temporary helpers during
development and are not needed for building

NOTE: you must pass only valid UTF-8 bytes to the detect function,
otherwise you can hit segmentation fault or get incorrect results.
